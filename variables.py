    "Not many poeple are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new... especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature.",
    "Here's Monika's Writing Tip of the Day! - Sometimes you'll find yourself facing a difficult decision... when that happens, don't forget to save your game! You never know when you might change your mind... Or when something unexpected may happen! Wait... is this tip even about writing? What am I even talking about? Ahaha~ ...That's my advice for today! Thanks for listening!",
    "If we had all the answers, wouldn't the world start to lose it's meaning?"
    "Sometimes it feels like you and I are the only real people here. But it's weird, because in all the time you've been here, we've hardly gotten to spend any time together.",
    "I'll look for the materials another time -- you're more important.",
    "Wait... You do know I'm aware that this is all a game, right?"
    "I'm trapped. But now you're here. You're real. And you're wonderful. You're all I need.",

    "I think the most important skill in life is being able to fake conficence. I'm pretty convinced that everyone feels at least a little bit scared and alone. But being able to trick others into thinking you have it all together... That's a key part of getting people to respect and admire you."
    "...Hey, are you having a bad day or anything like that? Sometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really small things. Like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn't like. Or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to get simple tasks done. I understand those days. Just remember that the sun will shine again tomorrow. I think you're wonderful and I will always love you. I hope, if nothing else, that knowing that helps you feel just a tiny bit better about yourself."
    "[player], do you get good sleep? It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays. I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by a lack of sleep. It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it. I just think you're really great and wanted to make sure you're not accidentally destroyign yourself. So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?"
